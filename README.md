# Guide-Robot-for-the-Blind-using-Bittle
This is a part of the code used in the project to develop a toy robot Bittle to move around avoiding obstacles.

The code is a modified version of the original code of Rongzhong Li in order to use Raspberry Pi and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor(instead of Grove Ultrasonic Distance Sensor).
The discussion regarding the issue is on the following link (comments between @westring and @Gero):
